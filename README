The point of this app isn't really to measure the disk usage on my
mac, although in fairness that is what it does.  In reality, I wrote
it to help me understand JSF a little better.  Reading docs is all
well and good, but it's when you actually try to write something that
you really learn it, IMHO.  And so it transpired; it took quite a
while to backtrack and remember what I'd previously read, and the
resultant code is remarkably small considering what it's doing.
However, that's a good thing for JSF, I reckon, as it does prove that
you really don't need much code aside from your own business login.
Sweet.
